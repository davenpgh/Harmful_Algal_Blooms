Assessing biotic drivers of brown tide formation from co-competing phytoplankton.

One specific pelagophyte phytoplankton, Aureococcus anophagefferens, causes a type of HAB known as an annual “brown tide” along the East Coast, from New York to Virginia. In recent years, A. anophagefferens has even been detected off the coasts of South Africa and China. These blooms pose a threat to ecosystems and humans by causing water column hypoxia/anoxia, recruitment failures in commercially important shellfish, and destruction of seagrass communities. When “brown tides” form, A. anophagefferens dominates the ecosystem, often to the complete exclusion of all other phytoplankton. A. anophagefferens blooms are a model system for studying HAB ecology. Previous research has largely focused on abiotic drivers of brown tides (e.g. nutrient input), but relatively little is known about biotic factors from co-competing phytoplankton. My research is focused here. Specifically, I am utilizing an RNA-seq approach to characterize the global gene expression patterns of A. anophagefferens in response to co-competing phytoplankton. Identifying specific allopathic genes can help us determine strategies that A. anophagefferens utilizes to outcompete co-occurring phytoplankton.
